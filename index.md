    1. I think overfitted is the most interesting topic for me this quarter. The situation could appear differently under different condtions. This phenomenon tells us that it is not the more hidden layers the better, but we need to find a proper number.
    2. A potential investigation to pursue would be how to improve the Neural Networks we see this quarter. Specifically, we would like to investigate how could we improve graph transformer process.
    3. Oversmoothing is too broad. I may specifically narrow down into a certain hiden layer.
    4. HTML is a very interesting web build language. We may try to build our website using HTML.
